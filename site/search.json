In this stage, you'll focus on mastering design fundamentals to the point where they are natural. This means learning how to optimize your CAD to be more parametric, mastering best practices and workflow that makes your CAD faster and more easily collaborated on, and learning more about engineering design and strategic design. There aren't any specific steps or projects in this stage; it's a lot more open-ended, and can be seen more as a \"choose your own adventure\".</p> <ol> <li> <p>Work on your own projects and get feedback. This could be mechanisms you don't have practice with, robots for specific games, or just anything you're interested in. Practice your workflow, optimize your CAD to be more parametric, and learn new ways of doing things. Make sure to get design reviews and feedback from team members, mentors, or in the discord server. As you get better, your improvements will be more in speed gains, parametric CAD, and optimizing load times.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>The \"design-review\" forum channel can be posted in to look for feedback with a more determined structure. Feel free to ask for more specific feedback.</p> </li> <li> <p>Examine and learn from examples of robots. Often the most important tool for learning is to look at examples of other robots. \"Steal from the best, invent the rest.\" Most things you'll ever need to design in a typical season have already been done in some form or another, and you can take easy inspiration from other teams while trying to improve it for your application. Open Alliance on ChiefDelphi is a great resource on the design and build process for many teams, and has a lot of public CAD.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn more engineering design. Refer to the Design Handbook pages and the deep dives in the mechanism examples pages. This includes how to assess potential forces on parts of the robot, pick the right materials, design rigid structures, learn more about what parts are available to FRC teams and how to use them effectively, and at a top level, what goes into designing good mechanisms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn strategic design. This means learning how to set priorities and requirements for your robot. This means basing your design off of your game analysis, those priorities, and your team's capabilities. This means learning how to design simply but effectively. This means learning how to structure a build season schedule and tradeoffs based off of your priorities. There are many resources for this, including Karthik's Effective FIRST Strategies presentation, Team 1678's training material, and Team 2910's Pop-Up Presentations. Combine this with good engineering design knowledge and CAD skills and most any team can design and build an effective robot and do very well in competitions.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p>","path":["Stage 4: Next Steps"],"tags":[]},{"location":"learning-course/course-setup/new-to-cad/","level":1,"title":"Introduction to CAD","text":"","path":["Introduction to CAD"],"tags":[]},{"location":"learning-course/course-setup/new-to-cad/#what-is-cad","level":2,"title":"What is CAD?","text":"<p>CAD is an acronym for \"computer-aided design.\" It's a software tool used by engineers, manufacturers, architects, and many more designers in industry to bring their ideas to life. </p> <p>CAD is used to create a 3D model from various kinds of steps and tools to help prototype, manufacture, and market a product.

There are many such settings we must specify when using features.</p> <p>Using a side profile of the cylinder, you may also use the \"revolve\" feature to create the cylinder.

Teams can iterate ideas before prototyping and manufacturing, and it helps cut down on prototyping time. Good CAD efficiency can help a team design a good robot in a timely manner, leaving room for software testing and drive practice.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Designing your robot in CAD allows you to make sure everything fits together perfectly. It is frustrating to realize you cut a part too short and need to recut an entirely new piece or when you need to drill random holes throughout your beautifully machined plates.</p> </li> <li> <p>While you may think your team is on the same page and has agreed upon a design, your whiteboard drawings may leave some room for interpretation. When you use CAD to model your design, everyone can see the end result and agree on a design and direction. </p> </li> <li> <p>Team members that were more heavily involved in the design process or ideation may know how the robot should function and how to fabricate it. This can leave them doing the bulk of the work. Using CAD can help those team members explain to other team members what they can to do to help build the robot. </p> </li> <li> <p>Newer team members that have not been involved in a robotics season before may have no idea what components and processes are needed to build a robot. CAD can be a great teaching tool to show those team members what is needed on the robot so they can help with the process too!</p> </li> <li> <p>The worst feeling is when you go to weigh your carefully constructed robot for the first time only to realize that it is 10 pounds overweight! You can measure your robot's size and weight in Onshape so you can make sure that it meets requirements. This gives you the opportunity to make changes before fabrication, such as using a pocketing feature to cut out excess material. </p> </li> <li> <p>CAD works like a digital blueprint and bill of materials of the robot. It allows you to figure out exactly what you need to order and make for the robot, and how it fits together.</p> </li> <li> <p>CAD skills are used in the real world all the time, when designing and testing anything from simple product design to large feats of engineering like planes or cars.

The purpose of a plate is to place mounting holes where you want them; the material that makes up the plate only exists to position mounting holes and create lines of support, like when using a triangle gusset.</p> <p>A plate sketch is composed of circles for the holes, arcs for larger corner fillets, and lines to complete the shape.

Set the pitch circles tangent to constrain the center-to-center distance between the gears. Constrain the centers of the two gears to be vertical.  2. Add the outline of the motor, a 2.5\" diameter circle, around the 12T gear that the motor is attached to. The layout sketch is now finished.    3. Create a new sketch for the motor plate. Using the layout as the reference, draw a 1.125\" hole for the bearing and a 1.25\" hole for the motor boss (the nub that sticks out from the motor). Note that depending on your manufacturing processes and tolerances, you may need to draw your bearing holes slightly larger or smaller than nominal (1.125\").   4. Add two mounting holes for the motor on a 2\" bolt circle. When using only two mounting holes, an alternative to using a circular pattern is to draw and dimension a 2\" construction circle, then draw the holes for the bolts on the circle. Make sure to constrain the angle of the holes as well; we used a horizontal constraint.   5. Add the four bolt holes for connecting the two plates. Use a center rectangle to create the construction geometry so that only two dimensions are required to constrain the holes.  6.

The 60T gear is the output, and we would like to constrain it to a specific location given by the 2\" and 4.5\" dimensions. 7. Next, draw the 5mm pitch 12T and 36T pulleys. Use a line to connect the two pulleys. Use the <code>#PulleyPD_5mm()</code> function to calculate the pitch diameters of the pulleys. Also space the 36T pulley to be 0.25\" from the vertical tube.

This will become more clear when you create the gearbox assembly. 12. Add a 2\" bolt circle for the motor with a circular pattern. Constrain the center of the top left hole to be coincident with the center line between the pulleys (coincident uses an infinite extension of the line)  13. Add the tube mounting holes for the plate. Note that the holes reference the edges of the tube and not the holes on the tube. This is to make the model more parametric, as changes in the tube can change the locations of the holes and break the gearbox plate sketch. 14. Draw the outline for the plate using centerpoint arcs and tangent lines. Space the bottom of the plate 0.25\" from the edge of the pitch circle for the 60T gear.  15. Add two holes for spacers. The construction circles represent the 3/8\" diameter spacer. The top hole is tangent with the left edge of the plate and tangent with the 2.5\" motor circle. 16. Extrude the plate to be 1/4\" thick. 17. On the opposite side, create a sketch for the inner plate. Utilize the <code>Use</code> sketch feature to copy over common geometry (holes, outline). Do not copy the motor holes, as there will be a cutout on the inner plate for the body of the motor. 18. Finish the outline of the plate by adding an arc for the motor cutout. 19.

Create a circle to represent the wheels, and a circle to represent the motor. Use the origin cube belt ctc function to position them correctly, this is similar to the layout sketch in 1B Exercise 3 4. Draw the pitch circles for both pulleys and add connecting lines for them to represent the belt path. Use the origin cube PulleyPD function to define the pulley circles 5. Draw a rectangle to represent a 2x1 tube. This should be dimensioned above from the wheels and aligned with the edge of the bottom tube. 6. Create a new sketch using a mate connector offset from the origin. This sketch should be offset in the \"Right\" direction as shown. 7. Transfer the rectangles for the tubes from the layout sketch using the \"Use\" tool. Make sure these are not construction lines as you will need to extrude them. 8. Extrude the bottom tube by 1\" towards the origin and apply Tube Converter to it 9. Start a sketch on the Right side of the 1x1 tube. Make sure to disable imprinting. Add circles centered on the motor and wheel circles from the layout sketch. Also transfer the CTC line with the use tool. 10. Create the bolt circle pattern by drawing a circle on the CTC line, then use the pattern tool to duplicate it around the motor center point. This pattern should have 8 holes, and have a diameter of 2\" to match the standard 2\" motor bolt circle. We only need 3 of the 8 holes on this pattern so make the rest construction holes. 11. Add mounting holes along the bottom tube, spaced 2\" apart. Add two more hole centered on the top tube spaced 1\" apart. 12. Draw the plate outline around the holes. Draw arcs around all of the edge holes and connect them with tangent lines. 13. Extrude to create the plate. If you properly disabled imprinting on slide 9 you should only have one face to select to extrude this plate. 14. Mirror this plate across the Right plane to create a reference plate. You should color this plate an abnormal color so it is easily distinguishable from the main plate. Name this reference plate \"zREF Plate\". This will make it appear at the bottom of the insert menu, making it harder to accidentally use in the assembly. 15. Extrude the top tube shape. Make sure to use the \"Up to Face\" setting to extrude the tube parametrically to the reference plate. 16. Use Tube Converter on this new tube. 17. Make a sketch on top of the 1x1 tube, again making sure to disable imprinting. Sketch the plate as shown. 18. Use the Robot Belt Featurescript to make a belt between the motor and wheel holes. Pay close attention to the starting offset and teeth values. 19. Create the wheel shaft using the Robot Shaft Featurescript. The start mate connector should be placed in the middle of the belt and run up to the left face of the reference plate. The shaft should be offset from the end by 1/16\" to account for the bearing flange. The shaft should also have a starting offset of 9/32\" to put it through the wheel pulley. 20.
